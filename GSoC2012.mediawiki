--><!--===Getting Started===--><!--
For GSoC2011 Google has posted some useful
[http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/03/dos-and-donts-of-google-summer-of-code.html DOs and DON'Ts for students].

Aside from Google's recommendations, here are some things you should look over before starting the main work on your project:
# Review our [[Code Style]]
#* Including the parts about commit messages and commit partitioning.
# (Optional) Complete the process to become a [[Member Types#Basic Contributor|Basic Contributor]] if you'd like to be able to contribute code into our edk2 tree.
# Determine where you are going to initially host your code
#* Your mentor will want to see progress on your project every few days, and this will be much easier in a separate project
#* Determine which source control system you will use.  Subversion would be a good first choice.  Git could be an options as well.  (You'll want to include your mentor in this choice.)
#* Some code hosting options: [http://code.google.com/hosting google], [http://sourceforge.net sourceforge], [https://github.com/ github]

--><!--===Working on the Project===--><!--
Here are some recommendations for use during the summer while working on your project:
# [http://www.google.com/search?q=commit+early+commit+often Commit early, commit often]
#* Besides being a good practice in general, this will allow your mentor to see your progress.
#* Proper [[Commit Partitioning]] can allow you to check in changes up to several per day.
# Ask questions earlier rather than later.
#* Use the [[edk2-devel|https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel]] list first, and your mentor second.  You should interact with our community as much as possible.
#* Questions are good.  Perhaps it'll point out some documentation that we need for our community.
# Create a timeline with some intermediate goals for your project.
#* Discuss the situation with your mentor if you need to adjust your goals.
# Don't copy source code, except from the main [http://www.tianocore.org/edk2/ EDK II] tree.
#* If you think some BSD licensed code from another project is required, make sure you discuss it with your mentor and jljusten.
# If you have an issue, and your mentor is not able to help you, then contact jljusten.

--><!--==Mentors==--><!--
# Be sure to look over Google's [http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2011/04/dos-and-donts-of-google-summer-of-code_21.html DOs and DON'Ts for mentors].
# Review the student section above
# Monitor your students work in their source repository
#* If you are not seeing regular updates, make sure your student is not getting into trouble
#* You should be in communication with your student, or seeing good results in their source repository at least every few days (at a minimum).
# If you have an issue, please contact jljusten.
