## News

- TianoCore is applying to be a mentoring organization for the Google Summer of Code 2021
- The last time TianoCore participated in GSoC was in 2012, it would be good to restart our participation.
- Here is the [official GSoC 2021 timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline)

## Students

**Next Steps**

- Look over our [[Tasks]] page and find one (or more) projects that sound interesting to you.
    - GSoc 2021 differs from previous years in that students projects are expected to be roughly half the work compared to prior years and spread out over a longer time period. The intention is that students will no longer work on GSoC full time for the entire summer. The stipend is also half compared to prior years.
    - Due to this change, it is recommended that students consider [[Tasks]] listed as either Easy or Medium difficulty, to ensure that they have ample time to complete the project.
- You **must** submit your project proposal to the TianoCore organization on the GSoC2021 page before April 13, 2021 at 19:00 UTC.
    - There is an application template below
    - The application deadline is **final**, so don't be late!
    - You can submit applications for more than one project if you find multiple projects interesting. Although, you can only be able to be assigned to a single project in the end.
- Please join our [edk2-devel](https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel) email list and start asking about the project you are interested in.
    - Let us know if you need more information!

**More information**

- Feel free to suggest you own project idea. It is best to discuss your idea first on [edk2-devel](https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel).
- Tianocore GSoC page: TBD

Note: We primarily use the [[BSD License]], and it is generally expected
that your project will be completed utilizing this license.
