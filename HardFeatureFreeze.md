After the hard feature freeze, the master branch in git is no longer open for
general development. Only bug fixes will be accepted until the next [stable
tag](EDK-II#stable-tags).

(This definition is modeled after QEMU's [hard feature
freeze](https://wiki.qemu.org/Planning/HardFeatureFreeze)).

# Announcing the hard feature freeze

The proposed schedule for the active development cycle is shown in the [EDK II
Release Planning](EDK-II-Release-Planning) article. Shortly before the hard
feature freeze, an announcement email is sent to the
[edk2-devel](https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel) mailing list.
The announcement is posted by one of the maintainers that are listed in
[Maintainers.txt](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/blob/master/Maintainers.txt),
in section `EDK II Releases`. And, tag edk2-stablexxxxxxxx-rc1 will be created.
