This task involves making several improvements for the standard shell text editor

* Status: Complete :heavy_check_mark:
* Difficulty: Medium
* Language: C
* Mentor: [[@jljusten|https://github.com/jljusten]]
* Suggested by: [[@jljusten|https://github.com/jljusten]], [[@ErikBjorge|https://github.com/ErikBjorge]], [[@jcarsey|https://github.com/jcarsey]]

=Status=
* Completed :heavy_check_mark:
* Work done by Suyu Yang for [[GSOC2011]].
** Source: http://code.google.com/p/edk2-editor
* Available in main edk2 tree

Issues:
* Plenty of wasted screen space
* Unusual hot-keys
* Hot-keys are not usable over a serial/network terminal connection

Nice to have:
* Support terminal widths as narrow as 60 columns

Location of editor code: [https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/tree/master/ShellPkg/Library/UefiShellDebug1CommandsLib/Edit ShellPkg/Library/UefiShellDebug1CommandsLib/Edit]

=Development environment=
Building
* This project can be completed on any edk2 supported OS or toolchain.

Testing
* This project can be tested on any PI 1.2 system.
* [http://www.tianocore.org/ovmf/ OVMF], [[Nt32Pkg]] or [[UnixPkg]] could each provide friendly test environments.

Here is the current look of the UEFI Editor:

==Search/Replace==

Ctrl-R should ask for the seach/replace on the bottom line.  First the search, then the replace text.
