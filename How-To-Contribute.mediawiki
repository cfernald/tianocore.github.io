Our community enables [[UEFI]] firmware and tools through various open source projects.
Most of our efforts are currently related to the [http://www.tianocore.org/edk2/ EDK II] project, so if you are developer, then this is a good place to start contributing to our community.

UEFI developers are the primary focus of our community, but if you are interested in trying to use UEFI, then we have a page on how to [[start using UEFI]].

There are several ways to participate in our community.  Anyone can join our [[Mailing Lists]] to discuss UEFI related topics.

If you are a developer, and would like to make [[Code Contributions]] to our community:
* Review our [[Member Types]] which documents requirements for contributing code
* Review our [[Tasks]] page which documents some open projects
* Review our [[Code Style]] page which documents coding styles and commit log styles
* Review our [[Inclusive Language Guidelines]] page which documents banned words and recommended substitutions
* Review our [[secure coding documents | https://tianocore-docs.github.io/EDK_II_Secure_Code_Review_Guide/draft/]] prior to submitting a patch, along with creating a unit test and performing some static analysis
* Recommend following some of the practices at [https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/]
* Do not post a patch to an unmitigated security issue. Instead follow guidelines at [https://github.com/tianocore/tianocore.github.io/wiki/Reporting-Security-Issues] 
* If a proposed set of patches also requires a change to [[UEFI]] or other industry standard specifications, then use the [[EDK II Code First Process]].
